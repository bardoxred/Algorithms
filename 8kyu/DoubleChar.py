# Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

# Examples (Input -> Output):
# * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
# * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
# * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
# Good Luck!

def double_char(s):
    tab = []
    for x in s:
        tab.append(x+x)

    return ''.join(tab)

print(double_char('hello'))
